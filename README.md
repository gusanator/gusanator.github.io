## General Info
As with many web pages, mine consists of three main files:
1. **index**: an html file
2. **style**: an css file
3. **code**: a js file
### index folder
[djrr.com] is my home page, where the journey begins.
Currently, i've three projects:
-   indexCalculadora.html, *a Calculator*
-   indexPiano.html, *one octave piano*
-    indexFeria.html, *report helper for work*

### estilos folder
Both **iStyle.css** and **jStyle.css** are used in the index.html file and you can toggle between them clicking the  query selector #icon.
Each project has it's owne css file:
-   styleCalculadora.css
-   stylePiano.css
-   styleFeria.css

### js folder
Both **logoChange.js** and **mainJS.js** are used on the homepage. 
**mainJS.js** controls the display of each project title, while **logoChange.js** toggles between **iStyle.css** and **jStyle.css**.
Each project also has it's own JS file:
-	calculadora.js
-	piano.js
-	feria.js

###  img folder
``img & icon``Folders contain media content that is used in the whole project.

## Technologies Used
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- ES6 JavaScript

I also use for workflow management:
- Git
- GitHub

## Setup & Usage
You only have to click [djrr.com] 

## Project Status
Project is: _in progres_
I want to use technologies such as REST API, React, and Express to implement additional apps on my homepage.
